## Development


```sh
yarn run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
